Collecting data remotely is one of the best benefit of collecting data via Data Foundry. Here is an example for collecting data remotely with TelegramBot of Data Foundry. I create a script running by Script dataset, and it will monitor / respond as Telegram bot to the participants in the same project according to the content. Also, all the results will be stored in IoT dataset.
