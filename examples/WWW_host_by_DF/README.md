### Description

In this case, I simply host web pages with a Complete dataset of Data Foundry.


### Reminds

1. If you'd like to upload new files, please make sure the dataset is ***active***.

2. If the files needs some updates, the uploaded(old) files have to be deleted first, then upload the updated(new) files, otherwise the new files will be dropped out instead of replacing the old ones.

3. All the files would be placed in the same level, no folders would be created or uploaded.


### Steps

1. Prepare the files for the web site: .html, .js and .css, etc.
2. Create a Complete dataset.
